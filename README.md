# GHDpt-cpp

This is a C++ implementation of the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book by Peter Shirley.

I added a GUI to the project to make it easier to experiment with the code. The code is multithreaded and uses a progressive rendering technique to give faster feedbacks.
